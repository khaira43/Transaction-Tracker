# Transaction-Tracker
A full stack transaction tracking application using React.js, Express.js, and Node.js.
Implemented responsive design principles and utilized fundamental UI/UX fundamentals.
Connected application to a backend database using MongoDB.
A private database is being used, therefore IP needs to be added to use.
Once IP is added to database, launch API using nodemon index.js and launch front-end application using yarn start.
Node Modules could not be added due to GitHub file limit.
